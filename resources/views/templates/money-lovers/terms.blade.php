                            <span>A. Nature, Formation, Modification and Duration of Agreement, Definitions of persons mentioned in this Agreement. </span>This Agreement (sometimes called "Terms of Service" in this Agreement) is made and entered into by and between "MONEYLOVERS.COM" (a business name of Social Logic, LLC, a New Jersey company) (also sometimes called "we" and "us" and "the Company" in this Agreement), and "you", a participant in the Affiliate Program administered by us, for good and valuable consideration, including, but not limited to our mutual promises in this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by you and "MONEYLOVERS.COM"; you will have expressed your assent, consent, and agreement to all of the terms of this Agreement by clicking on the link below ("Yes. I accept the Affiliate Agreement"). You become an "Affiliate" by entering into this Agreement when and only when we advise you that we have accepted it. We will accept it or reject your application after reviewing your application and investigating into it if necessary. Together, you and we are the "parties" as that word is used in this Agreement, but it applies only after we accept your application. Your participation in the Affiliate Program described in this Agreement is called an "Affiliation". This Agreement is subject to change by us at any time through a procedure calculated and designed to inform you of the change: Changes may include (only for the purpose of examples, but not limited to) modifications, alterations, and other changes in the measure, scope and amount of commission fees, commission schedules, payment procedures, rules of conduct and performance for Affiliates, and any other kind of change of any nature whatsoever with respect to the terms of this Agreement, whether like those mentioned or otherwise. If we decide to change this Agreement, when we do so we will send you a notification of each change at the email address you provided at the time when you applied to become an Affiliate, or if you have updated your email address in your profile, to that email address. We will also post the changes on the web page at this address: http://www.moneylovers.com/tos .You agree that this is a reasonable procedure that will reasonably and effectively communicate notices of Agreement changes to you. (You also agree that, should you determine to discontinue the use of the email address that you provided to us at the time of registration, substituting another email address, you will update your online profile with us by changing it to reflect the newly intended email address and by deleting the former email address before you cease monitoring messages in the former email account, insuring that our emails will always be sent to your active, current, monitored email address.) You agree that if you use any of the Services offered by this website after we have transmitted an email to you in this manner and we have posted it to the page whose URL is set forth above, you thereby give your agreement and consent to the Agreement as it has been changed, regardless of whether you actually read or received the email notifying you of the change or whether you actually did or did not read the changes posted, and those changes will become effective to modify this Agreement forty?eight (48) hours after we transmitted such an email to you. If you do not wish to consent to the changes in this Agreement, you must immediately and from that time forward refrain from publishing, displaying, or using in any fashion a) the name of MONEYLOVERS.com and any other domain name used or owned by Social Logic, LLC, and b) any graphic, text-based content, and any trademark belonging to us. This Agreement remains in force and effect until or unless it is changed in accordance with the terms of this Paragraph, is otherwise terminated under the terms of this Agreement, or until your affiliation is terminated by us for any reason. Some of your obligations to us under this Agreement (and as it may, from time to time, be amended) or under any successor Agreement, survive any change or termination of this Agreement and/or the termination of your Affiliation for any reason.
